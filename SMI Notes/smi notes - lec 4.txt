pyroelectric = external heat leads to development of temporary voltage

we can change the direction of dipole in ferroelectric material

remnant state = non-zero dipole moment

domain is a region where there are uniform dipole moments

berlincourt method :
D = charge density
sigma = stress applied
E = constant
Q = charge
F = applied force

rayleigh law = d33 decreases

spray coating = not homogenous coating , coating thickness is low
