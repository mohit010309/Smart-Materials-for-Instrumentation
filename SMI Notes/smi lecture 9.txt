sigma 1 = normal stress
sigma 2 = tangential stress

piezoresistive sensor behaves in linear way

higher sensitivity = higher gauge factor

is the sensor linear/non-linear
is the sensor repeatable/non-repeatable
K = plate stifness

strain directly proportional to poisson ratio
E = young modulus
