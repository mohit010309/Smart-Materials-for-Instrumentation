oscillation is used to create sound in buzzer

polarization at local level in peizoelectric material

peizoelectric material can work as a sensor
and also as a actuator

peizoelectric material as actuator can do precise positioning if we are able to control voltage

S = whole surface
da = area
q = net charge

sigma = stress
epsilon = strain

e = part of reverse peizoelectric effect


in example of peizoelectric effect :

if d15 is less , major component of polarization comes from the z-axis , P3
