optical fibre = total internal reflection , two different refractive indexes

uses : fast internet speed , information from one end to another end

peizo = to press
peizoresistor = as a sensor and actuator

more sensitive = results more accurate

why do we use accelerometer in cell phones ? = how much input , how much acceleration we need

length increases = diameter decreases

gauge factor = per unit change of resistance
